# 2017 Mar. 7 – Code Hoarding

Wow this is hard. 

Where did all these open tabs come from? 
How many spaces do I have open? 
Did I leave something important on my clipboard? 
When did my screen get so small? 

What was I doing?

These questions have been chasing me in circles for hours, 
usually having interrupted a good thought about how to better organize my code base. 
I started with trying to reorganize code. Code that is relatively small. 
Code that I had ALREADY WRITTEN. Code that I wrote in a messy 
“I’ve got to meet this deadline” kind of way.

I’m underselling myself- it’s not that messy. 

But there are a lot of files with half-baked classes and interfaces that I realized 
partway through didn’t really need their own space. So I merged the important parts into 
their respective classes and closed the file but didn’t delete it. You know, in case 
there’s something in there I realize I want later.

I’m a code hoarder. I’m also a tab hoarder. I need a trash collector for my Chrome sessions 
to free up all the tabs I haven’t looked at in weeks.  

**“I might need it. I can’t get rid of it!”** is not even a thought that occurs to me anymore, 
but it is the exact problem I need to counter. 

## And herein lies the problem:

## I don’t even notice the clutter building.

And what happens when it gets this cluttered? Suddenly it’s not about making GOOD code, 
it’s about digging through the piles to find the code that works at all. And not just that, 
but code that works with the other pieces of code that I’ve already found.

I’m exaggerating a little. 

## What I Already Do

1. I **write flexible code**. This way when I reorganize I don't have to also refactor. 

2. I **use verbose naming conventions** so I don't have to go looking for definitions if I forget something

3. I **organize my files in well-named directories** so I can't lose files. However, these may be *too*
specific because some files can fit in more than one place. This indicates that my organization is not
quite right yet. I will ponder this in another file and link it soon.

4. I **comment public methods and members in code documentation standards** for good reference and use later. 

And yet I’m still overwhelmed simply by *how much I have*.

So I suppose the lessons here are to just

## ORGANIZE IT OR THROW IT OUT 

1. Just do it. Just let it go. Close tabs, delete files that don't work.

2. If I can't figure out where it goes, maybe I've done something wrong. This should indicate to me that I need
to map out my projects beforehand so I can spot poor organization early. This should also help me write better 
code in general simply by having a clearer idea of how the functionality is partitioned.

3. Make better use of Github file tracking

4. Draw out the public interfaces I’ll need beforehand
