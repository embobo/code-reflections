## Objects and Forces

I've been reading 'The Geography of Thought' by Richard Nisbett which has given me some helpful perspective
on how I might better organize my work.
Nisbett presents a well thought out analysis of how Eastern (primarily China) and Western (primarily Europe) peoples 
approach the world differently. I won't describe it in detail here, but I will use the ideas to write this section.

Objects are nouns, they have properties that guide what you can and cannot do with them.

Be careful with these properties. Some behaviors are contextual. Contextual behaviors may not be inherent to the object.

Illustrative Example:

> A log will fall to solid ground because it is affected by gravity. This might lead to the conclusion that gravity is a property of the log 
> However in water the log will not necessarily sink.
>
> Rather, the log has two properties: `mass` and `density` 
> such that `gravity` *only pulls the log down* until it hits a surface that is more dense than itself.
>
> This shows that `gravity` is not a property of the log, but rather an interaction between itself and another object which depends on the properties `mass` and `density`.

What does this mean?

Objects have inherent properties, Operations dictate interactions between two objects. Think through methods carefully. Does it act using only the objects properties? Or is it a force between different objects? If it's a force, is it broad enough (like gravity) to warrant it's own (???file?namespace?whatisthis?)?

I'll be back to ponder this more later...
